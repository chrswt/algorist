# Algorist
JavaScript solutions for interview problems taken from The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Edition by Steven S. Kiena

## Running the Code
All the code has been written with ES2015 syntax, which newer version of Node.js are able to support.
However, older versions require an active Babel transpilation. First, run `npm i` to install all the require modules into the `node_modules` directory. There are two options:  
1. Use `-r babel-register` as a Node.js parameter
2. Install `babel-node` and run the code using that interpreter
