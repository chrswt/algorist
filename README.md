JavaScript solutions for interview problems taken from The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Edition by Steven S. Kiena

## Running the Code
The output for all code can be run with the newest version of node (tested on `v6.9.3`), which supports ES2015 syntax.
For older versions, transpilation using a `Babel` watcher or using `babel-node` is required. To run the code, simply 
execute `node [filename]` in the `/src` directory.
