## Running the Code
Most code has been written in ES2015 syntax, which requires an active Babel transpilation. First, run `npm i` to install all the require modules into the `node_modules` directory. There are two options:
1. Use `-r babel-register` as a Node.js parameter
2. Install `babel-node` and run the code using that interpreter
